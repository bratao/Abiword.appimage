# Abiword 

This is the best general office converter I know. This can convert multiple documents formats(odt, doc, docx, pdf).

My personal case is that I needed a converter from rtf to pdf, and could not find one that preserved the style.

The command is:
AbiWord-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run --to myfile.pdf myfile.rtf
